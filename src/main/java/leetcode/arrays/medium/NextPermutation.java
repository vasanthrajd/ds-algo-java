/**
 * : Given an array Arr[] of integers, rearrange the numbers of the given array into the lexicographically
 * next greater permutation of numbers.
 *
 * If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange to the lowest possible order
 * (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
 *
 * Input: Arr[] = {1,3,2}
 * Output: {2,1,3}
 * Explanation: All permutations of {1,2,3} are {{1,2,3} , {1,3,2}, {2,1,3} , {2,3,1} , {3,1,2} , {3,2,1}}.
 * So, the next permutation just after {1,3,2} is {2,1,3}.
